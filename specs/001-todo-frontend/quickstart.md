# Quickstart (Planning Artifact): Phase II Todo Frontend

## Goal
Implement the Phase II Todo **frontend only** (Next.js App Router + Tailwind + TypeScript), assuming backend APIs exist.

## Inputs
- Feature spec: `specs/001-todo-frontend/spec.md`
- Overview: `specs/overview.md`

## Planned execution order (high-level)
1. Establish frontend folder structure and base App Router pages.
2. Implement auth pages and session handling.
3. Implement tasks UI (list, card, form, filters).
4. Integrate API client and wire UI actions to calls.
5. Add route protection, error handling, loading/empty states.
6. Polish responsiveness and accessibility.

## Definition of done (frontend)
- Login/register + route protection works reliably.
- CRUD + completion + filtering flows are usable on mobile and desktop.
- Consistent error/loading/empty states.
- No backend code changes required.
